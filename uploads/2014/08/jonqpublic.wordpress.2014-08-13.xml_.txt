		<title>Why the Stargate Franchise Can&#039;t End a Series</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The point:</h2>

I'll be the first person to say it. I love the Stargate franchise. The original 1994 movie was awesome in the most campy way possible, and I thoroughly enjoyed the three shows that it spawned. (I don't count the cartoon, Stargate: Infinity, and neither should you).

But unfortunately the Stargate franchise doesn't know how to end a series.

<h4>Stargate: SG-1</h4>

Stargate SG-1 had a solid 10 season run, and there were atleast THREE season finales that could have been a series finale. But instead they completely copped out at the end of the series. The last episode was more of an homage to some of their better self-contained episodes from past seasons. At its core the episode had nothing to do with the massive plot going on that whole season.

The episode starts with a friendly race announcing "Hey Earth, we are all dying, so we are going to kill ourselves all at the same time in a massive explosion. So if you want all our technology and knowledge, you had better come get it before everything we ever did is gone forever." So the main characters go to the planet, get the knowledge and put it in their ship and fly off, then suddenly like 5 huge bad guy ships show up and start attacking them! Oh noooo! All that knowledge!

Through conclusion jumping they access the knowledge database and make a time bubble half a second before the bad guy ship shoots a death-dealing blast into their ship. This essentially saves them but traps them in a bubble where the outside world is going really really really really slowly but they are going about all normal-like. This is where the bulk of the episode is. After lots of time elapse montages showing like 50 years go by, one of the team says she figured out how to get out and save everything, but all this would be undone, except for whomever stayed behind to hit the big red button. That guy would be 50+ years older than the others when all is said and done, and would remember all that happened in their bubble. Of course they logically pick the alien guy who barely aged the whole time, and he hits the big red button, fixing everything and killing the bad guy ship. The show ends with them going back home all happy-like, but wait, they still have like 80,000 massive bad guy ships to destroy somehow. Oh wellz. Save it for the movies.

So they made a movie that wrapped everything up all nice-like and magic conquered all. Deus ex machina for the win! To put it plainly, the movie should have been the last two episodes of the show, because there was no reason to end the series on the annoying note that they did. It left EVERYTHING unsaid and incomplete. Atleast they attempted to wrap up things in the movie, but as always, movie tie-ins are always rushed and unfulfilling for the average fan.


<h4>Stargate: Atlantis</h4>

Stargate Atlantis also suffered from poor last-episode planning. In their series ender a bad guy ship magically figured out how to manipulate some power that they could never figure out before, and he made a super ship like 100 times bigger than any bad guy ship before. Oh and he also found the coordinates for Earth, so he sets a course for Earth, full speed ahead.

The Stargate Atlantis team hears about this and decides to save the day. Some of them use a stargate and jump right into the MASSIVE ship and start shooting some bad guys. One of them dies, but is quickly brought back to life. Another guy gets in a tiny ship and decides he is going to blow the ship up himself. All of the characters seem to think this whole endeavor is a quick walk in the park and rarely take this HUGE ship seriously.

So they casually try killing all the bad guys and of course, they arent winning. Here come the conclusion jumps! Back on the city of Atlantis, which is also a ship that doesn't have enough power to fly usually, they get some thing that lets them fly again, in space. Then one of the guys on the ship mentions that they have been working on this drive called a wormhole drive that they have never mentioned before, but it totally works like the stargate and brings you anywhere within seconds, and it doesn't even need a beginning stargate or and ending one. It just totally does it on its own, like magic, to save the day.

I often wonder what the notes on how this wormhole drive would look like...

<a href="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/atlantis.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70" title="Rodney's notes" src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/atlantis.jpeg" alt="notes from Rodney" width="641" height="322" /></a>

Thats it. They beat the bad guys RIGHT as they get to Earth, then they chill on their GIANT invisible space city ship right next to the Golden Gate Bridge. Everything's wrapped up forever, right? I mean there are still TONS of those bad guys left in the other galaxy, but who cares? They beat this one ship.

<h4>Stargate: Universe</h4>

Now Stargate Universe came along. The show's look and feel was completely different from the other two shows, and the tone was much more serious. The one thing that was great about this show was how practical things seemed to be. Characters would die, and stay dead (Chloe excluded..). The whole experience was something that wasn't your normal Stargate program. The problem with the show was pacing more than anything else. The plot felt much more practical and alot less in the realm of usual science-fiction. Mind you it was clearly science-fiction, but it had a completely different style. Like the other two shows, I was also sad when it was announced that THIS Stargate show was getting cancelled as well.

And the first thing that I thought about was, "Oh no! The show is getting cancelled! How will they wrap up the series? Maybe they will get off the ship they are stuck on, or maybe they will do some cool thing or all die or something." Well I was wrong. And the most annoying thing about this show was that they knew it was getting cancelled throughout the whole second half of the season. Now wouldn't that make you want to finish it off right? Go out with some sort of bang or start killing characters off like Dollhouse did?

Nope. Not at all.

Instead of getting a thrilling two or three part series finale, we got more of the same. The episode starts with them finding out there are more of this bad guy robot race who destroy all technology because they were programmed to. They realize that the robots are flanking them everytime they try to refuel their ship, so they decide to do what? JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! From this point on the whole episode is a series of ridiculous conclusion jumps. They can't refuel, good thing the stasis pods work. Let's get in those. Not enough fuel to get us there! Let's gate to a planet and get the stuff, theres a 100% chance we will find the exact minerals in great abundance at whatever the first planet is we find. Cool, we got the fuel stuffs, now lets go fast before some robots attack, ok they didn't attack, let's get in our pods and stuff. Half the people get into their pods and then they find out some of them wont be able to, but they jump to another conclusion allowing them to get around that problem. Now it's down to three people awake, one of the pods breaks, thus one of them will have to stay awake, but they don't have much time to live, so they have to get the pod up and running after the other two go into stasis.

Now here is where it gets good, ready?

The other two go into stasis being all "You will do it Eli. You're cool like that."

Eli, the guy left behind to fix the final pod, nods and smiles. Then he walks over to the pretty area of the ship and looks out at the pretty view of the stars.

And credits.

That's it. I'll give it to them though, they atleast didn't have too many deus ex machina moments. But they still jumped to so many random conclusions the whole episode. And it was so rushed that nobody was ever left caring that Eli was stuck and probably going to die.

Put simply: The Stargate Franchise does NOT know how to end a series. The writing for any other episode tends to be pretty solid on their shows, but any time they have to end something, they get cold feet.


<h2>Stargate Back story:</h2>

Just for some back story for all (or most) of you that have never  seen anything Stargate, I'll explain the movie and various shows.

Stargate  the movie was a sci-fi movie released in 1994. It starred James Spader  as Daniel Jackson and Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O'Neil (with one L).  In the movie a massive ring-shaped device is found in Egypt and brought  back to America. After years of trying to figure out how it works,  Daniel Jackson comes along and writes some stuff on a white board and  solves the problem, allowing them to activate the device which turns out  to be a wormhole-generating-device. The wormhole ONLY connects to a  single planet called Abydos. This planet is filled with people dressed  like ancient Egyptian slaves. They soon find out that a single alien  named Ra (like the Egyptian sun god) rules the planet. He was some sort  of E.T. looking alien who ganked some Abydonian kid's body a while ago.

All  sorts of action ensues and they kill Ra, and free the people of Abydos,  then go home. Oh but Daniel stays on the planet because he fell in love  with one of the locals.

That's the movie in a nutshell. The movie  was directed by Roland Emmerich, whom most people know as the director  of Independence Day, and Independence Day 2 (The Day After Tomorrow) and  Independence Day 3 (2012).

The original intent was to make a  Stargate trilogy, but that fell through since the movie was what many  mainstream audiences would call "too science-fictiony." Also it didn't  make that much money.

Three years later a few writers brought the Stargate idea back in a tv show on Showtime called "Stargate SG-1."

The  show varied from the movie in many ways. Daniel Jackson was now played  by Michael Shanks and Richard Dean Anderson played Colonel Jack O'Neill  (with TWO L's). Instead of allowing transportation JUST to Abydos, the  Stargate was now able to connect to many many many planets within our  galaxy. This allowed for an ongoing series where the characters meet  many different people from many different planets, making the  possibilities practically endless!

Stargate SG-1 tried to stay  within the realm of practicality when it comes to science-fiction. They  did so successfully until the last two seasons, where it became way more  science-fictiony than ever before. This did little to deter former  fans, but did not do anything to attract new fans.

The show went on for 10 seasons and then went off the air.

The  series opened up to a massive plot involving lots and lots of bad guys  coming to kill EVERYONE in our galaxy. When the show ended, it did not  resolve anything. They instead decided that fans would want to see that  massive plot in a 100 minute movie, resolved with quick magic and  classically bothersome deus ex machina ending.

&nbsp;

The  SECOND Stargate series was Stargate Atlantis, a continuation of the  first series but taking place in a new galaxy with new main characters.  If you thought that Stargate SG-1 was complicated science-fiction, you  hadn't met Atlantis.

The show's plot involved some bad guys who  are like space vampires. It was usually quite well written which made it  a bit easier to swallow the crazy plots going on. Lots of random stuff  happened with everyone being ok and happy at the end until the very last  episode. Out of nowhere they jumped to about 8 different conclusions  that drastically changed the outcome of what was to come. Once again,  they went with an almost deus ex machina ending where everything is  magically okay. Except now everything is drastically different because of all the conclusions they made.

The show ran for five seasons until it was cancelled.

&nbsp;

Then  came Stargate Universe. This show took a more serial take on Stargate,  where as both series before it usually had basic episodic procedures  that let you come in at any time. Stargate Universe was about some  people that get stuck on a big ship stuck on auto-pilot in a completely  different galaxy with no way home. The show ends much like Stargate  Atlantis did, with a series of conclusions being jumped to randomly  without good explanation, then randomly and abruptly ends. The only  difference with SGU compared to SGA was that there was no deus ex  machina moment.

The show ended after two seasons.]]></content:encoded>

As far as seminal television shows go, <em>LOST</em> is probably up there with <em>Dallas</em> and <em>Twin Peaks </em>for holding an entire generation's attention in a way that no other show could before or after. J.J. Abram's brainchild was one of the most watched, talked about and imitated televisions shows in the country. The combination of drama, mystery and suspense drew in viewers and captivated audiences to the point of obsession.

I was, I must admit, not one of the horde that drank the show in. I made one aborted attempt to watch the show starting with season two, but found the middle chapters repetitive and confusing, so stopped. However, as time has gone on, I have slowly come to regret not giving the series anything more than my passive attention (and later, contempt). Understandably, some shows go through slumps in their early-middle seasons. So starting now I want to make good. I am going to go through and watch the ENTIRETY of <em>LOST</em> over the coming months. The task seems pointless and thankless for a few reasons, prominent among them that I already know how it ends. Let's also not think about the disappointed horde still stung by its lackluster finale to ever want to hear about <em>LOST </em>ever again. My only consolation here is that if <em>LOST </em>was really about anything – which I doubt it ever really was – it was that the journey is more important than the destination. So with that in mind I'm going forward with "Getting LOST."

My goal is to understand not only why <em>LOST</em> was popular, but to look at exactly what made it popular. Even though we know now that the series very rarely delivered on the promises it made in its first few seasons, there must have been something else, something beneath the surface that kept viewers coming back week after week.

There is a fine line between popular art that is good and loved because it is good and popular art that is trash and loved because it is simple and easy to digest. Examples of both types of art abound in television and film (the former is heavy laden with obvious examples) and I want to know exactly which camp <em>LOST</em> falls into.

Here is what I know about LOST going into it:

<strong>1. It was popular.</strong>
Like, really really popular. There were very few people I know who did not watch <em>LOST</em>. In my office I was one of only two people who didn't watch the show on a regular basis. This show was a big deal to people. The only fans more rabid about their favorite show are fans of <em>The Wire</em>, and that's saying something.

<strong>2. <em>LOST</em> had a deep, often convoluted mythology.</strong>
The most intriguing element of <em>LOST</em> seems to be in its back story, which was deep and often confusing. Most of the mystery surrounding the show focused on the sci-fi heavy plot and its twisted, sometimes apparently nonsensical mythology. People still loved it and loved even more to talk about it.

<strong>3. It did not deliver on its promises.</strong>
<em>LOST</em> required the viewer to wager a lot of good will and faith over the course of six seasons. Its plot was a matrix of inexplicable mysteries that (we were implicitly promised) would prove satisfying and interesting resolutions. At the end of the show, however, a great many plot elements, events, characters and sign-posts turned out to be nothing but red herrings.

With that in mind, let's begin

***
<h2>"Pilot"</h2>
LOST has the unique distinction of having an absolutely perfect pilot episode. Any success that the episode can claim largely has to do with J.J. Abram's heavy involvement. Not only did he produce (as is his default role) but he also co-wrote and directed the episodes -- no small feat. His touches shine through: glossy production, snappy editing and a Speilbergian directorial acumen. Compared to <em>Star Trek</em> (2011) it's not impressive, but for basic cable it's fairly astounding.

More importantly, for a first episode (split into two parts) the characters are all amazingly well-formed. Even the ones who do not feature prominently are presented with care. The main characters (Jack, Kate, Charlie) are most impressively drawn through the use of interaction with the other survivors, each other and tactically placed flashbacks. In fact, I'd say the narrative arc in <em>LOST</em>'s first episode is some of the most ambitious story-telling on modern television. Abrams and company  rely heavily on dramatic irony, unreliable characters and are sparing in the narrative details other shows would gladly spew out in the first act.

There is little to dislike in the pilot episode of <em>LOST</em>. I suppose that the one complaint that could be made (if it is really a complaint) is that the episode hints at very little of the weirdness that would later come to define it in future seasons. In fact, if I knew nothing else, I would have assumed that <em>LOST</em> was nothing more than an updated version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <em>The Lost World</em>. Very little in this first episode hints at the bizarre, soft science-fiction that would later be a series staple. Although Charlie's last lines of dialogue are creepy and disconcerting enough to keep any mildly interested viewer coming back for more: "Guys, where are we?"

LOST makes an implicit promise that we are not in Kansas any more, and that is certainly something worth keeping an eye on.

Grade: A+

<strong>Spare Thoughts:</strong>

-LOST has a great sense of gallows humor (the "pen" gag at the beginning).
-Is Jack our hero or superhero? He seems a little too Superman in this first episode. I'm hoping the show tones down the "Everyman Boy Scout" shtick in later episodes.
-Did I see a <em>Godfather</em> reference?
-Locke is already incredibly creepy. I know where his character goes later on, and it's disturbing to see how weird he is even at the very beginning. Some serious planning MUST have gone into the plotting of this show.
-There are a lot of abusive relationship here. Some more explicit than others.
-Some of the secondary and tertiary characters are a little archetypal. I suppose that's alright for now.
-Good use of the medium w/r/t character development. I have a theory that the characters are really the only reason people kept coming back to this show week after week. I might be on to something there.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>TV&#039;s slow return to cliffhangers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone is familiar with the original Batman series starring Adam West, right? Each episode had the same setup, Bruce and Dick do something normal, a bad guy does something, they put on their costumes to fight them, and then.. TUNE IN NEXT TIME TO SEE HOW THE DARING DUO GET OUT OF THIS PICKLE!

Of course the next episode always started by resolving the problem, then resolving all the other problems, then they went on with whatever happens next. 

This is called a cliffhanger ending. It takes the usual beginning, climax and resolution plot and spreads it out, ending the episode on the climax without any resolution. The resolution comes at the beginning of the next episode, then that episode in turn often starts the process all over again.

Cliffhanger endings are completely different from movies to TV shows. With TV you know that they will resolve the ending in the next episode, but it still makes you want to stick around for the next episode to see how it ends. Movies are a bit riskier because fans might have to wait for 3 years or forever. And often the cliffhangers in movies don't pay off the way you think they should. But that's not what this article is about!

We are here to talk about cliffhangers in television!

You remember the 90's? They were ruled by the sitcom. Seinfeld, Friends, Boy Meets World, etc. They all followed a tried and true approach to each episode: 

Beginning: a problem is discovered/encountered.
Middle: the problem comes to the turning point/the climax.
End: A resolution is found and the episode wraps up nicely.

This even extended to the few highly popular dramas of the day like ER, Law and Order, Murder She Wrote, Matlock, etc. It was always the same ending, EXCEPT for the season finale.

The season finale of any show always had to end on a cliffhanger to seemingly keep the audience on the edge of their seat wanting more. That meant they would have to wait ALL SUMMER until the show came back.

Finale cliffhangers work quite well because as a viewer, you have already potentially been sucked into the show all season, so you want to know exactly how Matlock solves this weeks crime, or whether or not Corey and Topanga finally get married.

Well these days in television we are all still familiar with the cliffhanger. But I think it's safe to say we are MUCH more familiar with them now than we were in the 90's.

How many of you watched <em>Lost</em> when it was on? How many episodes probably ended on some sort of cliffhanger? Go ahead and take a minute to think about.

Yep, probably just about every episode, right?

Writers these days seemed to have found the secret of cliffhangers, and they seem to inject that secret into every show they can get their hands on.

Lost is a prime example because they started the new trend of every-episode-cliffhangers. After seeing how successful their approach was, every new show seemed to try emulating it. Often it failed for various reasons, and sometimes it worked. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460651/" target="_blank"><em>Invasion</em></a> is a prime example of a show that failed at the cliffhanger ending.

Many could and should say that it was trying to emulate <em>Lost</em> at every turn, just with a different plot. The series was about some sort of alien invasion slowly taking effect. You never knew exactly which characters were aliens and which were humans. The idea was that it would be a gripping story about people in a small town in Florida dealing with the extraordinary events. It had a solid idea, but it got cancelled after it's first season.

The blame could be passed around all you want, maybe it was poorly written, maybe the actors weren't as good as they could have been, but I think the answer is something much more sinister...

The writers didn't grasp how to make a good cliffhanger ending.

<em>Invasion</em> tried to emulate <em>Lost</em>'s episode style by ending episodes with cliffhangers that might be resolved in the next episode, but they missed the mark.

The reason it's hard to write a good cliffhanger in every episode of a show is because of the characters. Often times a show thinks that the audience has to like ALL the characters to get them to come back for the next episode. In truth you really only need a single character that everyone likes. It doesn't have to be the same character for each person either.

<em>Lost</em> had a plethora of characters for people to like for different reasons, one person might have liked Jack because he's a cool doctor that knows how to lead a group, so whatever the ending, they will watch to see what Jack does next. Someone else might like Charlie's lovable drug-addict persona, so they want to see what he does next. We need to have some sort of emotional anchor to hold us down to a show, and everyones anchors are different.

Once the writers have a character that people like, they can then write a good cliffhanger whenever they want and audiences will keep tuning in. Why, you ask? Because even if the cliffhanger has nothing to do with your favorite character, you can't help but think "well I wonder how this is going to effect Charlie or Jack." And it obviously grips audiences even more when the cliffhanger involves their favorite character.

<em>Invasion</em> didn't get that, and made only one or two characters remotely likable, which turned many potential fans off. It made their cliffhanger endings feel empty and meaningless because they always effected characters that nobody cared about, which left many viewers thinking, "Why should I watch the next episode? I don't really care if the Sheriff is a human or not.

A more recent example of solid cliffhanger writing is <em>True Blood</em>. I've talked to many people who watch the show but totally hate at least three characters on the show. But they have those few characters they love, so they stick with it.

<em>True Blood</em> has taken the <em>Lost</em> style of cliffhangers and perfected it. And in many ways it allows the writers to get away with often ridiculous or poor writing that most shows would never get away with so easily. <em>True Blood</em> can fill an episode with some of the most ridiculous fluff throughout an episode, but if they leave you guessing at the end, you always want more.

Viewers sit there and deal with the random stuff about fairies and werewolves through the whole episode, suddenly their favorite character gets bitten by a vampire! Then the credits role.

<em>True Blood </em>has found the loophole in television cliffhanger endings. They have figured out how to make the viewers think the whole episode was AMAZING simply because of the plot-twisting cliffhanger ending.

If you watch <em>True Blood</em>, go back and watch an episode with that in mind. There's a good chance that the episode is filled with random potentially ridiculous sounding dialog, but at the end you still want to see what comes next. It doesn't matter if any of the 50 minutes previous made any sense, because they probably didn't.

All that you or any viewer needs to get hooked into the next episode is a single character you like. The emotional impact of the cliffhanger might not have anything to do with your favorite character, but the cliffhanger makes you want to stay to see what they do with your favorite character next. Often the general emotional impact of a cliffhanger is enough to keep you coming back. The shared emotion of the cliffhanger with how viewers feel about a character makes for a perfect storm.

Now I'm not trying to say that <em>True Blood</em> is a bad show, but I believe that they as well as many other new shows these days rely on cliffhanger endings more than actual character development to keep the audience coming back. And that sucks.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Getting LOST :: &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;</title>

<a rel="attachment wp-att-534" href="http://jonqpublic.com/features/getting-lost-tabula-rasa/attachment/1x03_kate/"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-534" title="1x03_Kate" src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/1x03_Kate-608x335.png" alt="" width="608" height="335" /></a>

&nbsp;

The first two episodes of <em>LOST </em>stand pretty firmly on their own merits. Like any television pilot, they encapsulate the world that they are introducing us to. Pilots have to do extra duty just to get us all on the same playing field with characters, history and the more generic "rules" that govern that particular version of the universe. So it's no wonder that most shows fail to adequately live up to the efficiency or prowess of their first episode.

<em>LOST</em>'s third episode treads the line between rehashing the plot and narrative elements that made the pilot great and striking out into new ground with the characters and story. They do resort to some tired, "here's what happened last time" style dialogue, but it's brief and is a nice refresher (for those of us watching week-to-week). From there it dives directly into character development. I said it before but it bears repeating: the characters carry this show. In fact, the second episode is almost entirely character driven. Large chunks are given over to Kate's back-story and to Jack's struggle to keep the US Marshall alive without the aid of modern medicine. It's compelling television and I'm impressed that while juggling these larger characters arcs, the show also has time to stop and examine several other minor character relationships as well as set up new ones.

The ones that really matter here are between Kate, Jack and Sawyer. But also we have another good look at Walt and his dad, Hurley and Jack as well as a few of the minor characters popping in. I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that these new (largely binary) relationships tie back to Locke's little speech about good and evil (light vs. dark) in the second half of the pilot, and to be honest the show lays it on a little thick at times. The worst is the encounter between Jack and Sawyer on the plane. Second worst is Jack and Kate on the beach. <em>LOST</em> spares not time letting us know that it's about to get Biblical.

Which brings me to the next point: <em>LOST </em>significantly ups the melodrama in episode three. I can live with a little melodrama interspersed between the action. I don't even know if it bothered me as much as the accompanying strings (and well-timed rainstorm) did. On the bright side, if this show sinks any further into soap opera territory I'll officially have "shows."

Which, I mean, who am I kidding? I watch <em>Community</em> and <em>The Office </em>like it was my job.

Anyway, what the third episode weirdly avoids any of the strange, interesting or profoundly weird plot points that were revealed in the pilot. In fact, it's almost like this episode came from a completely different show. Sure there are call backs to the previous episode; characters are still worried about Polar Bears and not being able to contact the mainland because of an ominous signal blocking their efforts. But "Tabula Rasa" is purely and wholly about the characters. It's good that we're taking time now to get to know them, but still this episode struck me more as a lost chapter of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> than it did one of a science fiction mainstay. Are we meant to read hope in the last scene of this episode? Joe Purdy's sweet "Wash Away" seems to herald a change in fortune for the stranded survivors. I know that things are only going to get worse, so the song seems incongruous. The ending is more ironic than cathartic, but still. Were I watching this show six or seven years ago I'd be apathetic about the ending. Because at this point it seems like <em>Swiss Family Robinson</em> just got revived for the twenty first century. Give me monsters, give me danger. We're on the edge of the map guys, let's hope the next episode raises the stakes.

Grade: B+

<strong>Spare Thoughts:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Is that opening campfire a metaphor for <em>LOST</em>'s writer's room? "Tell them what we know -- they lose hope."</li>
	<li>Kate seems to find it necessary to keep Jack in the loop.</li>
	<li>Why is this show so amazing to look at? It's eye candy for sure.</li>
	<li>Still funny (although most of the humor falls squarely to Hurley in this episode).</li>
	<li>Man, that got dark there for a second.</li>
	<li>"We all died" -- the greatest (non) Red Herring in the history of sequential narratives.</li>
	<li>If Locke isn't already the bad guy by now I don't really know what the fuck is going on.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SDCC, also known as San Diego Comic Con, is one of the biggest comic conventions in the U.S. I was lucky enough to score a ticket after two solid hours of hitting the refresh button. Immersing myself with over 100,000 comic/movie nerds was one of the best introduction to the West coast ever.

There were so much to see and so much to do I felt like a kid in a candy store. Or a nerd at a Comic Con. Without further ado, here are<a href="http://jonqpublic.com/gallery/san-diego-comic-con-2011/"> a few shots from Comic Con</a>. By a few I mean 123 photos.

		<title>How Harry Potter Ruined and Revived Fantasy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/harry.jpg" alt="" title="Harry Potter" width="600" height="316" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1223" />

I know, the title alone sounds like I'm about to go into how Harry Potter is stupid and lame, right? Well you're wrong. Harry Potter was awesome for a lot of reasons. The books are timeless stories that get better and better with time. They play on lots of classic storytelling ideas in eventually well written ways.

Harry is the forever pure good guy. He has problems like anyone else, but he's a good guy. Voldemort is pure evil in every way. They fight. In it's most simple form many people can enjoy it for what it is, a fight between good and evil.

I remember reading the first book a long while back and thinking "Wow, this is kind of cool. I mean it's also a little bit ridiculous, but in a sort of practical way." The Harry Potter books started picking up lot's of steam by the third book especially, <em>The Prisoner of Azkaban</em>. By then there were rumors that they were going to start making them into movies, seven movies!

<blockquote>SEVEN?! There's no way they will be able to keep the same kids throughout all the movies. They will be like 35 by the time they are done. Who will believe that Harry Potter can grow a beard?!</blockquote>

Well believe it! Soon after book four came out, <em>The Goblet of Fire</em>, the first movie came out. And this is about the point when it became okay and sometimes cool to read Harry Potter, wear a Hogwarts shirt, use your wand in public...

Maybe not the last one. But still, Harry Potter started looking like something parent's could get behind for its wholesome storytelling to explain to kids that guys who have snake-nostrils are bad guys, and good guys wear glasses.

The stories got better too!

Each book revolved around a single year of Harry's life, so it was like growing up with Harry for most kids. As he got older the writing got more mature and more realistic. The world started to open up and Harry started getting exposed to the realities of life. Death, loneliness and magic wands. The three things all children must come to terms with eventually.

At this point I'm sure you are thinking, alright sure, Jon, you are praising the crap out of Harry Potter for being awesome or whatever, but the title said he RUINED fantasy as well.

Well you are right.

<h4>Harry also ruined the fantasy genre</h4>

The genre of fantasy is a broad one, but if you ask someone to name a fantasy story, they'll probably say Harry Potter, unfortunately the next thing they will probably mention is <em>Twilight</em>.

You might also start pointing out that the stories in <em>Twilight</em> are nothing like the ones in <em>Harry Potter</em>. Well you are right about that. But this is the thing with <em>Twilight</em>...

Many people started reading the <em>Harry Potter</em> novels as they came out. This meant that when the first three books came out, a vast majority of fans were young, very young. They grew up with the stories and stayed the major audience. Sure as the later books came along younger people started reading them, but the core audience of <em>Harry Potter</em> has always been the people who started reading them as they were originally released.

By the sixth <em>Harry Potter</em> book, the audience was all in their teenage years. They were young, impressionable, and looking forward to <em>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Price</em>. It promised a book filled with teen problems they could relate to while still having tons of awesome magic and fantastical elements.

At this point, the fans I'm talking about are predominantly girls. The female Harry Potter audience is the focus now, they were really the biggest bulk of the young Harry Potter audience, and still are.

So Imagine you are a teenage girl. You are looking for some more teenage fantasy. You just blew through the sixth Harry Potter novel and want MORE! Well lucky for you that there just happens to be a teen fantasy novel that JUST arrived in bookstores everywhere. It's even getting rave reviews! Maybe its time to check it out!

You buy <em>Twilight</em> and immediately find that your teen-fantasy fix has been fed. You don't have to wait two or three more years for the next Harry Potter, there's something else to read RIGHT NOW! And it's from a girl's perspective! And she is <strong>just like you!</strong>

Here is my point, Harry Potter left alot of its core female audience vulnerable after the release of <em>The Half Blood Prince</em>. These girls got a bit of fantasy and even more teenage kissing and problems. They wanted MORE and the most popular outlet was <em>Twilight</em>.

<em>Twilight</em>'s main character is fairly generic. If anyone reading this had read the <em>Twilight</em> series, try remembering how they describe how she looks. They don't really do they?

Stephenie Meyer knew what she was doing. By making the main character Bella quite formless and non-descript, she manipulated all of the hungry female fantasy readers into thinking THEY were Bella!

Now these girls are completely hooked on the idea that they can fall in love with a glowing fairy.. or vampire.. nah he's really a fairly. How else can he glow in the daylight?

Once Stephenie Meyer sucked people in by tricking them into thinking they were all Bella, she then had her way with them and forced vampirism to seem like the best thing in the world. Now all former Harry Potter fans were being seduced by shiny, glowing vampires and rugged, handsome werewolves.

After the seduction process, these original Harry Potter fans became the first of the ever-increasing teen fantasy romance genre.

Now the genre is being flooded by the same crap stories over and over again. Vampires, werewolves, fairies, flying witch doctors. Name any fantasy creature and there is guaranteed to be atleast 200 novels about the creature making it the most attractive creature ever, sucking the life out of teenage girls everywhere.

This is where Harry Potter ruined the fantasy genre. Now if you ask someone to list a few fantasy stories, they are bound to say something depressing like 'Oh well theres Harry Potter, OH and Twilight! And then theres [insert 1000+ random vampire or werewolf stories currently flooding the market]

And to think, the whole thing might have never happened at all if Stephenie Meyer hadn't released <em>Twilight</em> right after all those Harry Potter fans were left feeling vulnerable and exposed, having to wait another two or three years for Harry to start kissing Ginny or for Ron to finally kiss Hermione.]]></content:encoded>

<a rel="attachment wp-att-938" href="http://jonqpublic.com/reviews/simon-peggs-nerd-do-well-does-well/attachment/nerddowellcover-367x560/"></a>A while back I heard that Simon Pegg was set to release a book.  Not only was he writing a book, but it was an autobiography!  Initially I was excited and confused at the same time.  I thought to myself, "isn't he a little young to have an introspective" but also "how'd he get to where he is now, because I'm totally on the same wavelength."  Well, it turns out he had similar feelings when approached to write the book.  See?  We're already thinking alike.

&nbsp;

The book starts with quite possibly the most entertaining preface known to man.  I know that's not saying a lot since most prefaces are bland, and usually get skimmed over or skipped entirely.  If that is what you normally do when you read books, please don't even think about it with this one.  From the very beginning you feel the same nerdy wit that Pegg displays in his films &amp; television series "Spaced".  The preface is solely written for the American audience (thank you Simon), and explains some of the references that many mainstream American readers wouldn't normally get.  These references are usually to popular TV shows in the UK that have not made the transition over to the US.

&nbsp;

Each page of the book contains at least three humo(u)rous moments which will cause a smirk at the very least.  There were countless occasions throughout my time reading this book that I laughed out loud, sometimes to the point where I had to put the book down, so as not to get it wet with the tears which were streaming down my face.  Yeah, it's that good.  Now that's not to say that there aren't close personal stories included.  Simon (yeah, we're on a first name basis now) writes about close personal tragedies, romantic endeavo(u)rs and general tales of growing up nerdy.

&nbsp;

The book is very relate-able for the  Pegg-centric cinephile.  There are plenty of great stories from his life leading up to "Spaced", as well as the creative process involved in a brilliantly nerdy television series.  You find out how he met Nick Frost (co-star of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, &amp; Spaced), Edgar Wright (director of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced), and Jessica Hynes (Yvonne in Shaun of the Dead and Daisy in Spaced).  What makes it even more different from any other autobiography is that Simon weaves a send story throughout the book.  It was during these chapters that I laughed the loudest.  Overall it's a heck of an entertaining read, and by the time you reach the end, you're left wanting another 150 pages.  Also there's a couple of nifty picture page sections that sync up with the text.  It's a really good book, and I'd recommend you go out and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nerd-Do-Well-Journey-Becoming/dp/1592406815/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315687915&amp;sr=8-1">buy it now</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Throughout  all the videos posted of the various changes to the original trilogy (many of which are minor, and really didn't serve a real purpose) the gang at AintItCool posted a link to a great group of amateur photos taken in 1982 during the filming of Return of the Jedi.  It's really cool to see all these behind the scenes images, taken with the general knowledge of what they were seeing, but no clue as to the context.  I would love to have been there.

&nbsp;

Here's an example of the coolness you can see...

It was pretty cool seeing many of <em>The Avengers</em> cast at New York Comic Con. It might have been cooler if Sam Jackson or Joss Whedon were there too, but the crew that came instead was solid and entertaining.

<a href="http://panelsonpages.com/?p=44555" target="_blank">Panels on Pages</a> has filmed and uploaded the whole 45 minute affair for the world to watch!

Check out the whole panel below to see and hear a few clues on what is to come for <em>The Avengers</em>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lqp2l8Emyl4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Luckily we got in line early enough to get prime seats for the panel. But this brings up a new topic which is getting more and more popular these days, the New York Comic Con getting bigger and bigger.

Just a few years ago there were practically no lines to get into most of the major panels at NYCC, but this year there are more lines, more panels and alot more space being used for the floor booths.

We will be posting plenty of pictures from NYCC later this week, so stay tuned to see what the whole comic con looked like!

This past October 13th through 16th was the New York Comic Con.  I had attended before, but only for one Saturday.  This year some of the JonQPublic gang made the trip out to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Manhattan's West side.  One of the privileges I had was to attend the panel for <em>Green Lantern: The Animated Series</em>.  Attendees were given a full screening of the series' first episode, followed be a Q &amp; A with DC's Bruce Timm, co-creator of Harley Quinn, and the man responsible for TV's <em>Justice League</em>, <em>Batman Beyond</em> and much more.  I'll try to keep this as spoiler-free as possible!

&nbsp;

What I liked about this show was that it didn't start off with the origin story.  The producers essentially hit the ground running, giving us Hal Jordan on Earth for a few minutes.  We watched Hal break an expensive plane, save some people, flirt with Carol Ferris, and then be quickly taken away to Oa (something the feature film could have used a lot more).  Characters introduced there are Kilowog, Salaak, and the Guardians-- with Ganthet being singled out as a secret buddy to Hal.   Hal and Kilwog soon meet the main enemies for the first season:  the Red Lanterns!  They are lead by Atrocitus who has two other red baddies with him, Zilius Zox and a new recruit named Razor.  Basically we get the first main battle of the series, and it's really quite good.

&nbsp;

The CG used was a little strange at first, almost like a stylized version of the Incredibles-- but after five minutes I was on board.  The show doesn't really lack much from the first episode.  There's humor, danger and suspense all wrapped up in a nice 1-hour premiere.  This is a show that is just as much for an adult audience as it is for children.  The universe that is presented does not take the superhero battles lightly; we see more of an adult element played out with characters actually dying, instead of getting beaten up and just thrown in jail.  I think these themes will help it stand out from some of the other more cartoon-y superhero series that have been produced in the past.  Overall I liked the first episode as did my wife, Regular Jane, and we will gladly watch it.

		<title>The once and future Jon</title>

For all you followers of this site, thank you for taking the time to read what we write. In recent months the site has been fairly slow and filled with less than exciting articles.

I can honestly say that the most exciting thing on this site lately is all the news that we post, and even those are few and far between.

Instead, I want to tell everyone what the original plan for this site was, what it has since become and where it will be going in the future.

I have another site with my wife, Chy. We post everyday lifestyle things there, awesome pictures of food we make, what we did on the weekend (only if it was awesome) as well as whatever else strikes our fancy. It's a site filled with light-hearted things that we do in our lives, nothing too serious, nothing too offensive or opinionated.

One day I watched a movie trailer for <em>Anonymous</em> and thought to myself, 'Wow, that trailer was cool! Too bad the movie will probably suck balls or at the least be NOTHING like that trailer.'

I decided to write a post about it and I made to be sure I was as complainy and annoyed sounding as possible, because I was. The end result was a highly opinionated post about how movie trailers are great and most associated movies tend to suck, and that sucks.

The post really had no business being on a site where Chy posts adorable pictures of bento boxes she makes, and I write about how awesome olives are.

<div class="clearfix">
<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_9534-645x357-300x166.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_9534-645x357" width="287" height="159" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1335" />
<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/moar-taste-645x304-300x141.jpg" alt="" title="moar-taste-645x304" width="287" height="135" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1336" />
</div>

That's when I got the idea for <a href="http://jonqpublic.com">JonQPublic.com</a>!

My original intention with the site was to have a place where I could talk about why certain movies are awesome, and why many others totally suck ass.

The site was intended to be filled with mostly reviews and opinions/features. News was going to be second rate to all of that stuff.

Instead what has happened over the last few months is a whole lot of news, and very little reviews or features. We might have posted a rundown here or there, or a review, but more than anything it's just been news, light of any real content.

That's all going to be changing from here on out.

From now on, I, Jon Q Public, and my cohorts will be writing more of what's on our minds, reviews, reasons why Bruce Willis looks out of place in <em>G.I. Joe: Retaliation</em>, as well as 5 reasons why it's probably a good thing that <strong>The Rat</strong> is NOT helping to produce this years Academy Awards.

There will be a shift toward what we think about film, tv, games and whatever else, and less of an emphasis on recent news.

Let's be honest here, if you want recent movie news, you probably would have gone to another site, right? So why not come here to read about things like which Harry Potter film was better than its book counterpart, or why it's ok that <em>Expendables 2</em> will be PG-13.

Come here to enjoy our abilities to tear apart a film to see its core, as weak or strong as it may be.

If you only come here to read movie news, than continue to do so, we will still be posting movie news here, but the main focus from here on out will be what we think and why.

I hope you join us.

-Jon]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Missing the mark: Jurassic Park III</title>
		<link>http://jonqpublic.com/features/missing-the-mark-jurassic-park-iii/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/the-mark-608x237.jpg" alt="Missing the Mark" title="Missing the Mark" width="608" height="237" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-1360" />

You might be thinking, he must mean <em>Jurassic Park 4</em>, right? The one that Steven Spielberg recently mentioned might be happening, but he would not be directing. But NO! I speak of the 2001 epic (fail) film, <em>Jurassic Park III</em>.

Now let's talk a bit about why this film <strong>COMPLETELY</strong> missed the mark.

As usual with any sequel, there is a precedent of greatness from the movie before it. The original <em>Jurassic Park</em> was based on the bestselling Michael Crichton book of the same name. It was a pretty awesome movie and a technical triumph at the time. The film's CG moments still hold up against present-day efforts. The story was a bit haphazard, and took away plenty of depth that the book provided, but how many people actually want to hear people talk about a tiny chicken-sized dinosaur called <span class="tell">"procompsognathus"<span class="told">Procompsognathus: An animal mentioned about 1,000 times in <em>Jurassic Park</em> the book. They were later adorably referred to simply as "compys"</span></span> (such a long name!) or go into detail on how exactly the parks Cray supercomputers decode DNA? As a side note, my wife and I made a conscious effort recently to try talking about procompsognathus in an every day conversation to see how people would react. We were met with mixed/confused results.

<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/compy-608x196.jpg" alt="" title="compy" width="608" height="196" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-1357" />

Even the the 1997 follow up film <em>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</em> was a fairly solid effort. It strayed even farther from the Michael Crichton book than its predecessor, but still contained all the elements necessary to be entertaining while developing the key characters.

By the second film it became clear that there were a few "checklist items" that seemed to apply to making a good <em>Jurassic Park</em> film.

<ol>
<li>Make sure there is at least one child throughout the whole film.</li>
<li>Make sure the child incredibly useless the majority of the film.</li>
<li>Have raptors! LOTS OF RAPTORS! ROAR!</li>
<li>Be sure to have everyone running from dinosaurs a lot!</li>
</ol>

Unfortunately, the above checklist was NOT the end-all solution to building a great <em>Jurassic Park</em> film. Which lead to this:

<h2>Jurassic Park III: Keep Running!</h2>

The first two films had all the things in the above checklist, but they had something else that the third film must have forgotten about: a script.

I'm sure someone copy and pasted a few chase sequences into a document and tried calling it a script. So I guess we can say they at least "tried"...

So how did <em>Jurassic Park III</em> miss the mark?

Story.

Visually it was a pretty film, filled with plenty of big crazy dinosaurs, but it was missing all the character depth from the first two films. All the characters could have died at the end and we still would have been left thinking "Oh did someone die? I couldn't tell in between each scene of vague characters blindly running from dinosaurs.

The film even goes as far as to take Alan Grant, (the main character of the first film) and take all the depth from his character in the first film and flatten it out into a bland 2-dimensional character.

Apparently Grant didn't learn his lesson in the first film. <em>Jurassic Park</em> starts by showing Grant at a dig site in Montana. John Hammond comes and says "Come see my park! It's great!"

At this point Grant says, "No way, I can't! I have a dig here!" to which Hammond replies, "I'll fund your dig site!" And there off to the island!

Grant then goes to <em>Jurassic Park</em> and nearly dies and barely escapes with the other people. You would think that if anyone ever came to one of his dig sites in the future offering to go to an island filled with dinosaurs, he would probably just say no.

Unfortunately, Grant must have gotten partial amnesia between the first and second film, because what happens next is almost an exact copy of the first film.

Grant is at his dig site when an annoying looking rich couple walks up to him. They "just want to fly over one of the dinosaur islands" because...well..they're big fancy rich people! And that's what rich people do!

This should have set off about 15 different red flags in Grant's head. And it seemed like it did until the rich couple pulls out his ONE weakness: "I'll fund your dig site!"

Grant: "Well hell! Where do I sign??"

This pretty much negates anything smart the guy did in the first film. He has essentially rebooted to original Grant, with no memories of everything that happened in the first film.

Oh did I mention that he totally communicates with the raptors at one point too? He uses a replica "resonating chamber" from a raptor skeleton to tell the raptors "It's ok fellas, nothing to worry about with us! Here's your dino-eggs back, we cool, G?"

In the end, how did <em>Jurassic Park III</em> miss the mark?
<ul>
<li>Lack of script depth</li>
<li>Lack of any logic in the main character</li>
<li>Humans should never "communicate" with dinosaurs. They are big scary eating machines and thats all they ever should be.</li>
</ul>

Here's hoping that <em>Jurassic Park: IV</em> does NOT go the way they originally intended:

<h2>Jurassic Park IV: Raptor Assassins</h2>

Back in the early 1990's <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> exploded into the homes of children all over America. The show was awesome, giant green turtles who kick ass! All merchandising you can possible think of was created and sold to hungry fans wanting more and more giant anthropomorphic animal-human hybrid creatures!

this obviously led to the next logical step, copying it.

Among the top offenders are <em>Creepy Crawlers</em>, <em>Biker Mice from Mars</em> and my all-time least-favorite copycat: <em>Street Sharks</em>.

Instead of going on about why DIC Entertainment tried to copy the success of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, let's just talk about the end result, an incredibly illogical, disjointed mess of a show that was only thrown together because they had a toyline they wanted to sell.

<h2>What makes up a <em>Street Shark</em></h2>

Plenty of people could probably look at a picture of a Street Shark and figure out what it is at its base level, a guy with a shark head.

In the series, four brothers are kidnapped by a mad scientist and turned into half-shark freaks. The reason for this is never quite made clear. The evil guy already turned the four brothers' dad into some hideous monster, so it's not like he couldn't have just killed these four brothers instead of giving them the power to stop him from evil-doing every week.

So these four brothers are turned into shark-men! Oh noz!!!

Let's look at the details, and here is why pretty much NONE of it makes ANY sense...

<h3>Problem 1: The hands</h3>

Many less anatomically accurate cartoons opt to have all humans have 4 fingers instead of 5. Perfect examples: <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>Family Guy</em>.

In this form, everyone has four fingers, there are no real exceptions (other than God on the Simpsons). Such cartoons make it clear from the beginning that nobody has 5 fingers, the world they live in is filled with 8-finger problems.

The Street Sharks seem to be having a problem where their world is filled with 10-finger problems, and they are 2-fingers short.

Let's play a game, it's called <strong>Count The Fingers!</strong>

<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/skate-yo.jpg" alt="" title="skate-yo" width="380" height="285" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1388" />
<h5>Count: 5 fingers!</h5>

<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/street-sharks-wtf-608x456.jpg" alt="" title="street-sharks-wtf" width="608" height="456" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1389" />
<h5>Count: 4 fingers..</h5>

<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/nooooooo.jpg" alt="" title="nooooooo" width="380" height="285" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1387" />
<h5>Count: 5 fingers!</h5>

<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/no-fingers.jpg" alt="" title="no-fingers" width="600" height="372" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1386" />
<h5>NO FINGERS</h5>

Notice the problem anywhere? It seems like the conversation went something like this in the early stages of the show's development:

<blockquote>
<strong>Person 1:</strong> Hey guy's, I have a problem, I'm trying to concept what these shark guys should look like, but I'm not sure about the hands.

<strong>Person 2:</strong> Well we want them to hold things in their hands, so they should probably just have five fingers like they did when they were human.
<strong>
The Douchebag in the room:</strong> Well, I dunno guys. Four fingers seems like what cartoons do, right? And they are going to be really big guys, so bigger fingers look cooler than dinky fingers!

<strong>Person 1:</strong> But it doesn't make any sense, if we are going to give the shark guys 4 fingers, shouldn't the humans have 4 fingers too for consistency?

<strong>The Douchbag in the room:</strong> Who cares?! We already have them swimming through solid ground like it's water!

<strong>Person 2:</strong> Good point. Just go with four fingers, douchebag is right, it looks cooler.
</blockquote>

Even the Ninja Turtles had SOMETHING to back up the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-toed_box_turtle" target="_blank">some turtles have three toes</a>.

<h3>Problem 2: Teeth and the Digestive System of a Shark</h3>

This is a diagram of the anatomy of a shark:

<a href="http://www.infovisual.info/02/036_en.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/internal-shark-fo-realz-608x292.jpg" alt="" title="036 Internal anatomy of a shark" width="608" height="292" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1391" /></a>

As far as I can see, there's nothing there that says anything about being able to eat or process metal, cement, rocks or any other non-edible substances.

I think this is closer to what the creators of <em>Street Sharks</em> thought the inside of a shark looked like:

<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shark-innerds-608x268.jpg" alt="" title="shark-innerds" width="608" height="268" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1392" />

In the show the Street Sharks can be seen swimming through the street (thus their name! OMG!). In order to do this great feat, the sharks eat through the ground while at the same time kicking with their arms and legs, creating a swimming-like effect.

This must mean their teeth are made of magic, and their bodies poop seconds after eating, because there's no way they could get more than a few feet without their stomachs EXPLODING from the massive amounts of non-digestible matter being launched into it at like 15 miles per hour.

<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/explody-shark.jpg" alt="" title="explody-shark" width="400" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1393" />

<h3>In closing:</h3>

Now I know most of you at this point are saying to yourselves, "Why is this guy even wasting the time to point out how stupid some cartoon was?"

There are two reasons,

1. Even though <em>Street Sharks</em> was a poor, half baked idea from the start, they gave us a powerful word that I use every day,

<img src="http://jonqpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/jawesome.jpg" alt="" title="jawesome" width="500" height="636" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1394" />

2. <em>Street Sharks</em> will never be as awesome as the original badass anthropomorphic team of crime fighters, the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>.

Therefore I must resort to a bit of delightful childishness:

NINJA TURTLES RULE! STREET SHARKS SUCK!

<em>Street Sharks</em> can SUCK IT.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you ever watch cable (mostly the USA channel or TBS) then you've probably noticed that <em>The Mummy</em> and <em>The Mummy Returns</em> are on just about every other month. Besides, you wouldn't want to forget Brendan Fraser yelling at his loudest for two hours, right?

If you do NOT watch that much television, then there's a very good chance that you all but forgot this film.

Let's discuss why.

You might recall <em>The Mummy</em>. The first one. The plot ran like a classic adventure film: very little plot with lots of fun action. The main character is a cool American who flys through every situation by the seat of his pants and never looks back to see who he killed or why.]]></content:encoded>
